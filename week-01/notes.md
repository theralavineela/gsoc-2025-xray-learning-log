# 📅 Week 01 – GSoC Learning Kickoff 🚀

**Date:** April 14–20, 2025  
**Focus:** Planning and preparing for the Interactive Database for X-ray Analysis project (OpenAstronomy GSoC 2025)

## 🎯 Goals for the Week

- Create and organize this GitHub learning log ✅
- Read basic concepts:
  - What is a light curve?
  - What is X-ray astronomy?
  - What is the Stingray library used for?
- Start installing necessary packages (Stingray, Astropy, Jupyter, etc.)
- Begin exploring example light curve code (if time permits)

## 💬 Reflections

I haven’t yet started hands-on work, but I’ve planned my learning and created this space to track my weekly progress. I’ll begin exploring light curves using Python and Stingray this week and document my journey here.

## 📌 Notes

- GSoC Proposal submitted ✅  
- Mentors have suggested reading project docs 📝  
- Mid exams coming up (Apr 21–24), so balancing time carefully  
- Repo created to stay consistent and visible in the community
